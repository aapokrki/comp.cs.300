# comp.cs.300
My university's Data structures and Algorithms course's large project.
The final project is in /prg2/ and it contains the same base as prg1. 

This project was done in 2 parts. 
Part 1: general functions and tax path algorithms
Part 2: roadnetwork algorithms

This project contains an interactive map software where you can to multiple different commands:
add towns, remove towns, create vassalships and roads between towns and much much more. 

Used graph algorithms in part 2. 
BFS(Breath first search), 
DFS (Depth first search), 
A*-shortest route, 
Kruskal's minimum spanning forest 
and more in part 1.

More information about design choices of functions can be found ![here](README_prg2.pdf) in finnish.

The main focus on this course was time complexities of the functions and different algorithms. 
The following pictures show the performances of the functions and algorithms when N = Amount of towns changes.
